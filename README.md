# Locality Tracker iOS

The question is pertinent: where are we from?

Locality Tracker: The Boundary Awareness App is an up-and-coming Android and iOS app that strives to make users more aware of the boundaries around them. First developed in September 2019 in Richmond, Virginia, Locality Tracker’s mission is to highlight the relevance of representational boundaries to one’s location.
